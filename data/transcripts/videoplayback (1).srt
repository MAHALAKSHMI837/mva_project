1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When every choice echoes across a million worlds, some faces return changed.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Reality is a pattern. I will redesign it.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We hold the line, not hand it over.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He's not just a man. He's an end.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are not intruders. We are a response.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We fail.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Everything dies.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Order must be engineered.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We either stand together or fall apart.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He'll make a god of himself.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You never listen, brother.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hold your thoughts. Hold your hope.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Chaos is an old friend.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then let's greet it together.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will end this and begin again.
